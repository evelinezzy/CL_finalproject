I chanted to her om ami dewa hri and Amitabha mantras while she was alive and right after she was gone. I've been continually chanting mantras mentally for her since she departed and doing all god deeds I've been able to in these three days. I know I need to let go, but I'm in such deep grief... she was with me for 12 years and she was my first cat. I tried to give her the best life I could. I hope she felt how much I loved her.
At the end I couldn't stand it and before she was gone (and after) I asked her to find me again.
She was a pure soul and she showed me how to be a better person.

1h0u40b,Focus on what's important,konchokzopachotso,719,https://i.redd.it/oxhzw0nrxc3e1.jpeg,https://i.redd.it/oxhzw0nrxc3e1.jpeg,19,1732675474.0,"From the grand scope a Bodhisattva must have, the issues of this world are not nearly as important as the immense issue that is ignorantly tumbling through cyclic existence. Focusing on this is of the utmost importance. Sentient beings need help desperately, and the only way for them to be helped truly is for them to be inspired upon the path of Liberation. 



From a much more mundane scope, genuinely striving along the path will make you a more compassionate and wise person. Being around someone who is more compassionate and wise leaves a positive imprint in everyone's mind. This imprint can grow into more people developing more compassion and wisdom. Think for yourself, in your own life, how has being around loving people affected you? What about angry people? Even if that angry person is righteous and well informed. How does that anger affect how you then treat others? Are you kinder to people when you're righteously angry? No.


Follow the advice of the great Sages, focus on cultivating your mind, lessening your negative actions, and increasing your positive actions. Don't let the worries of this life, and these circumstances of this world thrust you deeper into the pit of poisonous emotions. Focus on developing right view, meditation, and conduct. 


Just some thoughts I've been having thinking about the state of the world these days. "

I have been on and off with practices, its hard for me to sit down and read my spitiual books due to personal laziness and no discipline, i do meditaton but i havent in weeks and its sometimes hard for me. so many things but i never stuck to it long term. When i visited the temple, i cant even describe it, i just felt like crying, getting it all out and just, be at peace but i heald it in, in fear of judgment from family. Does this feeling have any meaning? I pretty emotional and i do feel urges to cry when seeing beautiful sights but this time just felt different. Has anyone else had similar experiences?

I don‚Äôt want to lose myself through those awful surgeries, radiation, and chemotherapy, nor do I want to watch my loved ones suffer. 

Over the past 1.5 years, I‚Äôve lived happily and peacefully without cancer, and I can‚Äôt let it change that‚Äîbecoming a burden to my loved ones, experiencing pain, and losing my sense of self.

In embracing this decision, I draw upon Buddhist mindfulness, which teaches us to live fully in the present moment. This awareness helps me find peace in the face of uncertainty. Each breath I take is a reminder of the beauty of life, urging me to cherish what truly matters.

I also reflect on the Five Remembrances:

I am of the nature to grow old.
I am of the nature to get sick.
I am of the nature to die.
Everything that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change.
My actions are my only true belongings.
These truths guide me as I navigate this journey. 

Although I can‚Äôt predict how long I will live, I promise to hold on to my essence and make the most of the time I have left. Rather than undergoing painful treatments, I will prioritize my quality of life and spend my remaining time doing what brings me joy.

I‚Äôve struggled with this decision for about three weeks, and I finally believe it is the right choice for me. I choose to stay true to who I am, to enjoy every moment I breathe, and to embrace happiness.

When the time comes, I look forward to the joy of choosing my last meal, my last hug, the last song I‚Äôll listen to, and the last words I‚Äôll say. 

My cancer, my decision!

Be kind,

I'd like to share some of what I've learnt during that time with everyone here.,Perpetual_DM,379,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1dh4jca/ive_been_a_buddhist_theravada_for_20_years_id/,,58,1718533014.0,"I just wanted to share some things I've learnt over the past 20 years of practicing Buddhism. I wanted to share what I know with all the lovely people here. Maybe it helps some of you. If you want to ask something feel free and I'll try to answer as best I can. I'm not an expert, so feel free to disagree.

1. Virtue/Morality is the foundation of the path. Basically keep the 5 precepts
2. Buddhism is a path increasing joy. A subtle but more powerful joy. This joy is not created by anything connected to the senses. It's difficult to explain but there is a greater happiness than what is available to us normally. It is very difficult to notice at first because it is a flavour of happiness we've never tasted and thus it is easy to overlook. I can personally attest to this greater joy being real, though I feel like I'm only sipping from that pond. I haven't swam in it yet. Yet even sipping it has been life changing for me. Maintaining virtue is a key part of developing this, which is why I said it in the first point.
3. If you find yourself losing interest in normal things but don't experience the joy I spoke of then you're missing a key part of the path. At these times it might be best to not practice so hard, or reassess things and try something new. Visiting a monk for advice is a good trick too if things aren't clicking.
4. What is letting go? Letting go is accepting, truly accepting, that you don't need it. You can let go of things temporarily (such as when we meditate, we let go of everything but the breath but afterwards we return to normal), or long-term (such as abandoning/letting go of a bad habit/viewpoint). I like to remind myself of my past lives: that in those lives I probably had partners, children, a job, bills etc. but when I died I let that all go, i didn't need to hold on to them anymore because I had a new life to live. Now, I don't remember any of those really important details from my past life. I let it all go when I didn't need it. In the same way I try to let go of things that interfere with that greater joy and peace.
5. Forgive yourself. This is a difficult one for a lot of people. Yet I feel its very important to finding peace and joy in one's life. We've all done things we either regret or wish we didn't do/say. No matter what it is, why it happened, or the pain it caused others. You still deserve love. You still deserve forgiveness. Please be kind to yourself and forgive.
6. Examine things for yourself too. You don't need to accept everything in buddhist doctrine to practice buddhism. You can take things one step at a time. Anything you haven't had a direct insight to yourself you can take on faith or just leave be until you have reached a point where you pick it up and re-examine it again. For example: Is rebirth real? There is an established way to find out for yourself which involves deep meditation. It's okay to wait until you realize it yourself and until then take it on faith in the Buddha.
7. Try not to turn everything into an academic activity. What I mean by this is that we walk the path not stand at the starting line discussing the path. Don't get me wrong, its perfectly okay to investigate, discuss, examine etc. but dont forget the other important bit: putting into practice!
8. Take it slow with medtiation, you'll naturally get better at it over time. You'll get there, patience is key!

That's all I can think of for now, feel free to post questions bellow or message me if you want to remain private.

With metta, Thank You!"

After that my interest in buddhism started growing quite a lot. 

I always had imagined how would a discussion between sri guru nanak and sri gautama buddha would go, considering both dharmas believe in reincarnation and breaking free from it. Correct me if i am wrong ‚Äú buddhist belief is to break free from cycle of death and rebirth and be one with the universe and become a buddha‚Äù this is quite similar to sikhism however‚Äù achieve liberation and become one with the god‚Äù in sikhism god is universe, god lives in its creation and is everything so in a sense its essentially being one with the universe the only diff in Buddhism universe is universe while in Sikhism god is universe. I would imagine both the great beings would possibly have really good discussions on these topics. 

What u guys think, at this point in my life both sri guru nanak and sri gautam buddha have aided me to become a better human although i still succumb to my desires and lust, and sometimes i perform actions od good karma because i want something in return.

Being interested in Eastern Philosophy more, I do say that NƒÅgƒÅrjuna skepticism and his skeptical positions are perhaps greater than Descartes himself. He phenomenology is profound, I wanna learn its mechanics. He's radical, but if you studied and mediated on his work it's even more radical yet successful in terms of negating the negations to affirmation. It may be radical to say that his Neti Neti (Not this, Not that) is on a level of its own.
Not only that, but he is probably the most misinterpreted (and strawmanned) philosopher particularly from his critics. He is indeed ""one of the greatest thinkers in Asian Philosophy"" according to Wikipedia. A person I know described Nagajuna as such and I think fits really well:

> *NƒÅgƒÅrjuna is a cat and nihilism is toy. And he has other toys to play with. He negates the negations and affirms himself by negating himself. You though you were finding your mouth, but you were just biting your own tail. The whole time you stacked a noun over a verb. He negates the negations of the critics, then his critics find him at the back door pouring their tea. Without that there is nothat. Without nothat there is no that.

I know it can be a controversial topic, but it is a necessary and important discussion to have in any community. If you are against secular/mainstream approach to mental health in the west, my post will likely offend you. Please proceed at your own discretion.

Edit: As one commenter has rightfully pointed out, the post comes through as kind of preachy and may seem as my attempt to put myself on the pedestal as somehow morally superior to anyone else in this community. It was not my intention. I have preserved the post in its original state. But please remember that I am just another stranger on the internet. This post is my personal opinion. Please treat it as such. Much thanks to the person who pointed this out. 

Time and time again I see a very worrying trend emerging in the ""New"" section of this subreddit. People come seeking refuge in the sangha, describing very serious and very dangerous mental health afflictions. Be it extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, or substance abuse issues, we should not take this lightly as a community.

The problem lies not in the affected individuals seeking help here, but in often low quality advice they get from the comment section. I want to address those in distress and the rest of us, who, in good and generous intention, sometimes accidentally or out of ignorance, provide unhelpful or even harmful commentary.

If you are suffering and you seek refuge in sangha, I want to show my utmost admiration for your courage. I spent over a decade stewing in my emotional problems before seeking out help. Because I was so hesitant, I will never be healthy again. I wish I was more like you when it mattered most.

Take refuge in the triple gem. But remember that mental health, just like physical health, needs real treatment if the injury is already acquired. Just like Christians would not (or should not) pray over an open fracture, we should not meditate on suicidal tendencies, for example. Seek out professional help.

I understand that you may not be able to afford therapy with a licensed fancy-pants double PhD doctor, but there are many other options. Look for local support groups, group therapy, check what your insurance may cover, ask about mental health support at your workplace. If you are in crisis, or feel like you are nearing crisis, look up your local hotline and save the number on your phone. Put it on speed dial maybe. Educate yourself. Now is as good a time as any, and it may save your life.

Now to the rest of the community. I understand and appreciate the overall atmosphere of acceptance and good intentions. Nevertheless, we have to be aware of our own biases, ignorance and delusion. We may share a teaching or our own experiences out of good intention. But without seeing the full picture we may be doing more harm than good. The individuals we are addressing may exist in an extremely fragile state of existence and our seemingly harmless comment may tip them in the wrong direction.

How to proceed then? How to find the ""middle way"" of supporting those in need? Simple answer is to provide gentle support. Treat them with grace, respect and kindness they deserve. Educate yourself on mental health first aid using reputable sources. Provide calm and gentle guidance to professional help or resources.

In conclusion, please be kind, understanding, respectful and supportive of yourself and others. You deserve the same amount of respect and support from yourself as you may offer to others. Educate yourself. Educate others. Let us continue to provide a generous, helpful and respectful sangha for other to take refuge in."

I just started talking to them like I talk to my cats, and giving them funny voices and such. Then it's easy to see them as lost or confused, rather than disgusting.

It's not always possible. We had bedbugs a while back and there was nothing I could do about that, they were hazardous to our health. I do feel a bit conflicted about that. But I've been doing what I can."

I've seen claims along the lines of, ""Well, If someone's from the west, then they're 'culturally Christian,' so they can't be Buddhist!"" Or that, ""Buddhism is being misrepresented in the west, because apparently the west is more secular!"" And I disagree with both of these claims. Your race, ethnicity, or country of origin should not determine whether or not you are Buddhist, nor how religious you are. Must it also be noted that cultural traditions often intertwine with the religious traditions they are connected to, and the idea that there is a ""true interpretation of Buddhism"" is wrong because culture and religion combine all the time and the culture will always be different based on the area. If anyone disagrees with my position, I would like to know your reasoning and why you believe the way you do. This isn't intended to be a debate or conflict, I am just curious as to the reason behind your position.

Response to these claims

Just woke up to see 46 notifications. Apparently my post garnered a lot of attention, and here's the most common claim I'm hearing. ""People in the west adjust traditions affiliated with Buddhism to make them more secular."" This is not really true at all. The west is not more ""secular"" it has a different interpretation of religion and philosophy than the eastern regions. There are plenty of deeply religious people in the west, as there are in the east. This claim also negates the fact that there are plenty of less religious and more secular people in the east. Are we then going to state that people in the east adjust their traditions to meet what is more secular? Well, this is probably true, but this is inconsistent to the point that this is just a thing in the west. This is the issue with generalizing a whole entire geographic area. You thereon have to generalize another. Conflating ""western Buddhism"" with being secular is a pretty big generalization, if I must be clear."

I'm fascinated by the encounters of the Greeks and Indian civilization during the time of Alexander the Great, Ashoka, Menander, Kanishka... 

Those gave rise to Greco-Buddism and remarkable syncretism that pollinated until what is now Japan.

Now Europe/the USA and others are deeply connected and allied with Buddhist's countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, or region that are spiritually important for Buddhism like Tibet.

Modern science, a good part of ancient greek philosophical knowledge ( Plato, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Epicure, Aristippe...) and concept are well know and preserved, just as different Buddhist schools of thought ( even those that disappeared ).

All this knowledge never available before are here , with a raising popularity of Buddhism in the west, popularity of martial arts ( a weird way of introduction of buddhism but Judo did introduced me to it years later lol) and also great penetration of western knowledge in the East.

I think we are at the beginning of something great! Maybe some form of Secular Buddhism ( already existing I know)?

I would practice loving kindness towards him when he treated me badly.  I told myself and him that I would always forgive him.  This felt good and transformative to me at the time.  It was only a couple of years ago when this relationship ended badly that I realized how damaging this was to me.  I considered myself an open and loving person before, with awe and gratitude for the world around me, and in fact this is how my practice made me feel.  Now this is gone:  I am incapable of feeling loving kindness towards myself and others.  I have withdrawn from loved ones and am afraid of new emotional connections.  I have lost basic coping skills.  I constantly feel despair, bitterness and anger.  I have been going to a therapist, but i feel there is something lacking; I am feeling philosophically and spiritually stuck, and have had little progress in the years I have been dealing with this.  I have an aversion to any meditative practice.  I stopped going to sangha meetings.  When I read dharma talks I get angry.  I feel I can no longer relate to most of the messages being conveyed.  I am looking for perspective, and possibly readings/resources.  

Edit: if you just read this post, and you feel like commenting to say anything about abuse victims being doormats, as so many already have, please just don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs dismissive and not helpful.  Certainly not the perspective I‚Äôm looking for.  

Many are being very assuming about what abuse is.  I‚Äôd just ask that you reflect first about what assumptions you are making, and if that is driving your reaction to what you just read.  

Please do not assume that abuse victims are doormats or do not have loving kindness for themselves.  Being incapable of loving kindness NOW is a result of abuse, not a cause for it.

2nd edit: I very much regret having made this post about abuse and giving it the title that I did.  As some of you have pointed out, I am not communicating effectively.  I very much wish instead I had just asked if anyone had had a complete loss of faith in the Buddhist philosophical and spiritual worldview, what helped you, and how you came back if you did.  "

Why am I just sharing now? I just got over the trauma and feel brave enough to share now. Also, when I talk to other Dharma friends, it seems they‚Äôre completely unaware of the suspect donation/fundraising practices as well as the character of the ‚ÄúLama.‚Äù 

While I‚Äôm thankful to her for giving me blessings to go to New York retreat and receive my Ngondro transmission, it‚Äôs been downhill since then. 

I hold Jetsunma as another sentient being who is suffering greatly. I‚Äôd appreciate if others didn‚Äôt seek her out and abuse her or harass her or KPC. 

May all beings benefit. "

Rebirth as a non-human being with four flaws

First, there are four types of rebirth as non-human beings:

(1) Hell: There is constant pain of cold and heat, and there is no time for practice.

(2) Hungry ghosts: They suffer from hunger and thirst all day long and have no chance to practice.

(3) Animals: They suffer from ignorance and servitude, and have no opportunity to practice.

(4) The Heaven of Longevity: Located near the fourth level of the Heaven of Great Fruition, the celestial beings who are reborn here¬†have been in meditation¬†for many¬†great aeons¬†without any thoughts, so they will not have the opportunity to practice the Dharma. If they are reborn as one of the four non-human beings, they will not have the time to practice the Dharma.

The Four Perfections of Being Reborn as a Human

Next are the four types of reincarnation as humans:

(1) Borderlands: Rebirth in remote areas where¬†Buddhism¬†is not very popular. People there regard Buddhism as a theology or something very strange. In some places, even the names of the Three Jewels are not heard. Some people are born in the Central Plains where Buddhism is very popular, but due to family reasons, they know nothing about Buddhism. These people have no chance to practice the Dharma.

(2) The Buddha does not appear in the world: Although one does not reincarnate in a remote place, the Buddha does not appear in the world, just like the dark kalpa, so there is no opportunity to practice the Dharma.

(3) Those who hold wrong views: Even if they are reborn in a place where the Buddha was born, they may¬†develop¬†wrong views and not believe in what Buddhism does. In this case, they will not have the opportunity to practice the Dhamma.

(4) Dumb: Although they do not have any wrong views, they are extremely stupid and ignorant. They do not have¬†the ability to think¬†after listening to the sutras or the Dharma . Such people do not have the opportunity to practice the Dharma.

Like many, I've been having a rough few years. I feel fortunate that my practice and the Dharma have kept me grounded enough to stick around - but I've lost a lot of friends over the last decade. Most were deaths of despair. My heart has been broken so frequently that the focus of my practice has almost exclusively turned to sitting with my grief and hurt and feeling it fully, then praying for my friends and family that got lost in samsara.

This is my altar in progress. 

I started and stopped writing this post as I was filling out the memorial shelf - I was absolutely overcome by how many funeral programs and obituaries I have to memorialize. My dharma books on the left will need a new shelf. By the time this is done both the middle shelves will be full of memorials. I realized I'll need another light to illuminate their memorials and while rigging up some LEDs, I lost it. I miss my friends. I wish I could have helped them more. 

I'm sorry that there isn't more of a point to this post other than personal catharsis - I desperately needed to express my grief and now is not an appropriate time to reach out to my normal people. 

I hope you're all well tonight.

I really struggled for a long time, and I'm hesitant to say I'm in the clear from depression. But I'll share my story anyways. 

Long story short, I was deeply traumatized by a terrifying life event (basically my life was threatened), and looked up how to recover using Buddhist framework (since my faith system is deeply rooted in the scientific method, I guess I thought Buddhism would be a good way to mentally recover), and google basically told me *everything was an illusion*! My identity, meaning in life, my values, everything I'd built... just a grand illusion. Nothing exists unless it's being perceived, and I just couldn't wrap my brain around it. Basically my brain was like **illusion = nothing is real.** 

It sent me into a deep, deep spiral for many years (3.5 to be exact). I was already extremely emotionally vulnerable as my amygdala was in full-blown crisis mode, so I went from completely normal, functional adult to getting an OCD, depression, anxiety, and trauma diagnosis overnight. I had soft suicidal ideation for about 2.5 of those years, and developed agoraphobia, etc.

... 5 different classes of antidepressants, over 20 different therapists (going once every two weeks without a break for over 3 years), unsuccessful EMDR, CBT, ACT, group therapy, hypnotherapy, rigorous exercise plan, and 3 different sleep aids later and my doctor gave me some pretty bad news recently that I may have treatment-resistant depression.

But something in me had enough. I finally realized that despite knowing everything is an illusion... you still gotta live. You gotta do stuff you love, that fulfils you. Despite it being an illusion, it doesn't make my experiences less real. I can kick and scream and resist but life goes on. 

**None of the treatments work for depression until you accept reality for how it is, not what you want it to be.** I believe this to actually be a core message from the Buddha. We suffer because we want reality to be different when it isn't. 

**Life is hard for everyone, and I'm no exception**. I'm not sure why it sucks so much, maybe that'll come to me later, but for now I have to live by my core values, find meaning, look forward & hope, and work towards my goals. I am looking forward to rebuilding my life moving forward. 

Life goes on, and I can accept that or keep fighting it. But I have to make it through, because even though it's hard, it's worth it. If it doesn't add peace, joy, value, and love to mine and everyone else's life... it isn't worth it. I can let it go. I don't even need to analyze it. 

If you're in a similar boat my heart really goes out to you. You got this. We got this. "

Atleast as per my understanding, even if foreign tourism is here, it is not as prevalent and intense, as for example the Haj Pilgrimage of the Muslims to Saudi Arabia.

I just wanted to understand, why is it so? Is it because, Budhist people prefer going to the temples within their own country? Would be happy if you can share some insights.

*""Lord, there is a country called Sunaparanta. I am going to live there.""*

*""Punna, the Sunaparanta people are fierce. They are rough. If they insult and ridicule you, what will you think?""*

*""If they insult and ridicule me, I will think, 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with their hands.' That is what I will think, O Blessed One. That is what I will think, O One Well-gone.""*

*""But if they hit you with their hands, what will you think?""*

*""...I will think, 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a clod.'...""*

*""But if they hit you with a clod...?""*

*""...I will think, 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a knife.'...""*

*""But if they hit you with a knife...?""*

*""...I will think, 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't take my life with a sharp knife.'...""*

*""But if they take your life with a sharp knife...?""*

*""If they take my life with a sharp knife, I will think, 'There are disciples of the Blessed One who ‚Äî horrified, humiliated, and disgusted by the body and by life ‚Äî have sought for an assassin, but here I have met my assassin without searching for him.' \[1\] That is what I will think, O Blessed One. That is what I will think, O One Well-gone.""*

*""Good, Punna, very good. Possessing such calm and self-control you are fit to dwell among the Sunaparantans. Now it is time to do as you see fit.""*
